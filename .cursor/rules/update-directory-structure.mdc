# Directory Structure Update Rule

## When to Update
The directory structure documentation in `.cursor/rules/directory-structure.md` should be updated when:

1. New directories or files are added to the project
2. Existing directories or files are renamed or moved
3. New services or components are added
4. Kubernetes configurations change (new services, ports, or IPs)
5. Development environment configurations change

## How to Update
1. Use `list_dir` to verify current structure
2. Update `.cursor/rules/directory-structure.md` with:
   - New directories and their purpose
   - New configuration files
   - Changed service endpoints or ports
   - Updated development URLs

## Key Sections to Maintain
- Main Directories and their subdirectories
- Configuration files in each directory
- Kubernetes Services configuration
- Local Development ports and URLs
- Environment-specific settings

## Current Service Ports
Remember to keep these port configurations in sync:
- Frontend (auth-ui): 80 (container)
- Backend (auth-service): 5001
- Redis: 6379
- Development ports may differ from production

## Note
This is a living document - keep it updated as the project evolves to maintain clear documentation of the project structure.
